====== install methods ======
Created Saturday 16 January 2021

Windows -> rufus + arch ISO + USB/whatever = arch install media

Follow arch installation guide on wiki mostly:

Boot from USB
Set kbmap
	$ loadkeys sunt6-uk
Connect to internet with iwctl
	$ iwctl device
	[iwd]# device list
	[iwd]# station wlan0 scan
	[iwd]# station wlan0 get-networks
	[iwd]# station wlan0 connect [SSID]
		(replace wlan0 with other devices as necessary)
System clock
	$ timedatectl set-ntp true
Disk partitioning:
	$lsblk
		gets disks and how they're mounted
	$fdisk /dev/sda
		starts the partitioner on the device sda (replace as necessary depending on what lsblk spits out
	o to create new partition table (DOS)
	n for new partition
		probably use default start space, can choose default end for whole disk partition or specify size eg +4G for 4 gigs
	w when complete
making filesystem
	$ mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda1
		(replace sda1 with whatever partition you're using)
Mount the new root:
	$ mount /dev/sda1 /mnt 
		(sda1 is the partition with the file system)
Install the base package onto the new root:
	$ pacstrap /mnt base linux linux-firmware networkmanager wpa_supplicant neovim
		Can install other software now by appending package names here, alternately, install any time forwards when using pacman
Fstab file:
	$ genfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab
Change root into the install:
	$ arch-chroot /mnt 
timezone:
	$ ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/Europe/London /etc/localtime
	$hwclock --systohc
Localization:
	EDIT /etc/locale.gen UNCOMMENT en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8 and any others
		en_GB.UTF-8 UTF-8
		ja_JP.UTF-8
		(include jp utf 8 too)
	$ locale-gen
	$ echo LANG=en_GB.UTF-8 > /etc/locale.conf
	$ echo KEYMAP=uk > /etc/vconsole.conf
Network
	$ echo [hostname] > /etc/hostname
	$ nvim /etc/hosts
	edit /etc/hosts to the following:
		127.0.01 localhost
		::1		localhost
		127.0.1.1 [hostname].localdomain [hostname]
initramfs
	$ mkinitcpio -P
root password
	$ passwd
Boot loader
	install microcode now
	There are multiple here that work - grub used most often so far for me, works in most cases too.
	assuming grub:
		$ pacman -Sy grub
		$ grub-install /dev/sda
			(sda = disk being used for root)
		generate grub config file
			(note, may want to edit timeout in /etc/default/grub to be 0 seconds before running next command)
			$ grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg

Finish up
	$ exit
	$ reboot

proceed to Later setup
