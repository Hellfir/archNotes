====== screen capture ======
Created Saturday 30 January 2021

	$ sudo pacman -S grim slurp wf-recorder
	
export $GRIM_DEFAULT_DIR in .bashrc to set default screenshot save location
grim saves screenshot to default location, unless filepath specified at end of command
slurp allows to select a location on screen, and outputs coordinates/size.

so
	$ grim
just saves full screen screenshot and
	$ grim -g "$(slurp)"
selects a location and saves that small chunk

	$ wf-recorder
will just start recording the whole screen as an mp4
similarly,
	$ wf-recorder -g "$(slurp)"
will record only a certain section of the screen

note that recorder has no default save location
