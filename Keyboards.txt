====== Keyboards ======
Created Saturday 13 March 2021

Keyboard emits scan code
scan code is interpreted as key code by kernel
key code is mapped to output by OS

key code mappings are stored in keymap files in /usr/share/kbd/keymaps
notably, i386/qwerty/ and sun/ dirs

"strings as usual" refers to ancient strings from VT102 - for escape codes and such

In bash:
	$ bind '"\e[24~":"foobar"'
	outputs foobar
	$ bind -x '"\eW":"who"'
	executes who
	
need to find how to add that to a keymap

for mouse: 
	change profile button is event19
	all other buttons event18
	pointer event17
	in libinput
	
	sway inputs has 4 profiles, 2 consumer control 2 normal
	unsure how corresponds to libinput
	event19 is a consumer control button
	
for keyboard
	can't find macro keys in libinput
