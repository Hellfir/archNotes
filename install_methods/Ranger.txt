====== Ranger ======
Created Thursday 04 March 2021

pkgs:
	ranger
	w3m (if trying to make img previews work in termite)
	kitty (terminal emulator)
	python-pillow (allows kitty to show image previews)
	
cool CLI file manager
do
	$ ranger --copy-config=all
to get files into .config dir
 then modify rc.conf to have previewer set to kitty, and image previews as true
modify scope.sh to uncomment video/pdf image previews as well (and recomment pdf text preview)
