====== ffmpeg ======
Created Friday 29 January 2021

cutting up videos:
base command is 
	$ ffmpeg -i [input file] [output file]
adding flags before -i makes them input flags, putting between input and output makes them output flags

-ss seeks to timestamp before starting
-t limits time to X seconds (as input reads only X seconds, as output only outputs X seconds)

eg
	$ ffmpeg -ss 30 -i [input] -t 20 [output]
will seek to 30 seconds into input, then stream 20 seconds to output before stopping
resulting in a 20 second video composed of the input from 30 seconds onwards.

$ ffplay [file]
plays a file :o
kinda like MPV but no on-screen controls.
can seek by clicking across the window (ie clicking left side seeks 00:00, right side is end of file)
