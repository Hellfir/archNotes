====== Fiddling in boot ======
Created Sunday 02 May 2021

e2label is needed on the root part for the arch.conf given on the wiki page for systemd-boot

	For UEFI boot and separate home folder:
		use gdisk
		1GB EFI part (EF00 code)
			this has to be formatted as FAT32
				mkfs.fat -F32 /dev/sdXY
			this part will be mounted to either /efi or /boot
		50~GB root part
		rest can be home
		split as you like

cp contents of /boot to a temp folder
mount EFI part to /boot
mv the temp folder contents back into the newly mounted section

mount home part to /home

must run bootctl install

after that add loader.conf into /boot/loader/loader.conf
and add a arch.conf (or other entries for other OSes)
